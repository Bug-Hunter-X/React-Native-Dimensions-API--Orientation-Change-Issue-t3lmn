This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The issue is that the `Dimensions` API doesn't immediately update its values when the device orientation changes. You might get the old dimensions even after the screen has rotated.  This results in UI elements being misaligned or incorrectly sized.

```javascript
import { Dimensions, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {/* UI elements using width and height */}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    width: width,
    height: height,
  },
});

export default MyComponent;
```
